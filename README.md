# UFOs
## Overview of Project
This project aims to create a webpage and dynamic table to help end-users conduct an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The users will have the ability to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Search criteria include:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Results
### Home
Upon entering the site, users are welcomed to explore historical UFO sightings.

### Preview of the data table and filter pane
Scrolling below the welcoming messages, users have a preview of all data available on the website.

### Using search criteria
As mentioned in the overview, users can utilize different search criteria to filter the data to their needs. The filter works by simply typing the requirements in the respective filter element, hitting the "Enter" key, or clicking outside the search box. To reset the filter criteria, delete the original input.

In the image below, we can see an example of how the data is filtered based on specific search criteria:

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One of the major drawbacks is that the user must know the specific data points within each search criteria. First-time users wouldn't be aware of, for example, the date range of the table or all the different shapes recorded for UFO sightings. 

### Recommendations for further development
#### 1. Change filter elements from search boxes to dropdown boxes
Changing the elements in the filter pane to dropdown boxes would allow users to know all the different filter options within each search criteria. Moreover, it would resolve possible input errors such as:
- Additional spaces after typing a word
- Case-sensitivity issues
- Inputting incorrect date format

#### 2. Reporting UFO sightings
The welcome page states, "Dig through the data yourself, and let us know what you see.". However, in the current format, users cannot contact the page administrator or report UFO sightings that they have experienced.
